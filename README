NAME
    File::umask - Get/set umask via (localizeable) variable

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.01 of File::umask (from Perl
    distribution File-umask), released on 2014-05-14.

SYNOPSIS
     use File::umask;
     printf "Current umask is %03o", $UMASK; # -> 022
     {
         local $UMASK = 0;
         open my($fh), ">", "/tmp/foo"; # file created with 666 permission mode
     }
     open my($fh), ">", "/tmp/two"; # file created with normal 644 permission mode

DESCRIPTION
    This module is inspired by File::chdir, using a tied scalar variable to
    get/set stuffs. One benefit of this is being able to use Perl's "local"
    with it, effectively setting something locally.

EXPORTS
  $UMASK (exported by default)
SEE ALSO
    Perl's umask builtin.

    Umask::Local.

    Other modules with the same concept: File::chdir, Locale::Tie.
